I am a Principal Statistical Scientist in the department of Data Science and Statistics at Genentech and an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Statistics department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Prior to joining Genentech, I received my Ph.D. from the department of Statistics and Applied Mathemetics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where my research focused on constrained optimization for computer experiments. Nowadays, I spend most of my time at the intersection of clinical and nonclinical statistics here at Genentech.

My research interests include:
- Bayesian statistics
- Bayesian optimization
- modeling of computer experiments
- nonclinical biostatistics
- data visualization
