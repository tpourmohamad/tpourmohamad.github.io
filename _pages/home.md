I am a Principal Statistical Scientist in the department of Data and Statistical Sciences at Genentech. Prior to joining Genentech, I received my Ph.D. from the department of Statistics and Applied Mathemetics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where my research focused on constrained optimization for computer experiments. Nowadays, I spend most of my time at the intersection of clinical and nonclinical statistics here at Genentech.

Additonally, I have joined the Statistics department at the University of California, Santa Cruz as an Assistant Adjunct Professor. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests include:
- Bayesian statistics
- Bayesian optimization
- modeling of computer experiments
- nonclinical biostatistics

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to inquire about potential academic collaborations.
