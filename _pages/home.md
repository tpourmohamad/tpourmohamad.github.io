I am an Associate Director in Exploratory Statistics at AbbVie.

Previously, I was a Principal Statistical Scientist in the Department of Data and Statistical Sciences at Genentech. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics and Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where my doctoral research focused on constrained optimization for computer experiments.

In addition to my industry role, I am an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Statistics Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Broadly speaking, my research interests include:
- Bayesian statistics
- Bayesian optimization
- modeling of computer experiments
- clinical and nonclinical biostatistics

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to inquire about potential academic collaborations.
